In the "ODBC Driver" combobox you can specify or choose from the list
the name of a JDBC/ODBC driver class, which you would like to be used
to establish connection to an ODBC data source.
<BR>
The default driver comming with Java:
<BR>
<code><B>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver</B></code>
<BR>
can always be selected, but you can specify or select also other ODBC Driver classes,
which you have included in the Prot�g� class path.
<P>
    <I>Note</I>: The most elegant way to include database drivers for DataMaster
    in your Prot�g� classpath is to place the <code>.jar</code> file containing your driver
    directly in the DataMaster plugin directory, located in
    <BR>
    <code><B>[PROTEGE_INSTALL_DIR]\plugins\edu.stanford.smi.protegex.datamaster</B></code>
    <BR>
    and restart Prot�g�.
